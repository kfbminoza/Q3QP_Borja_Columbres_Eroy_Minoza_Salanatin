Punching Game!

How To Play:

From our respiratory link, you can deploy our game by going to settings and choose pages and there you can see a link to our game. Once you've pressed the link you've made it to our game!
In our game you can see you and your opponents health, choosing a coin face, and different buttons

2.) Firstly you need to choose your coin face, after that press the "Toss Coin" button. That button determines if the coin face is heads or tails which decides whether you or your opponent goes first! 

3.) If what you choose matches the coin face you get to go first and attack. If it doesn't match your opponent gets to go first, where you will pick whether to attack or defend!

4.) After determining who's first you and your opponent take turns and you'll choose whether you want to attack or defend 

5.) Play until one side reaches 0 hp and determine the winner of the game!

5.) You may press the reset button to play again!

We hope you enjoy the game!
